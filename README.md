# 🌟 Text Summarization using NLP 🌟
## Group 3: V. Srujana
## 📚 Project Overview 📚
This project focuses on the development of an automatic text summarization system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to create a system that can efficiently transform lengthy documents into shorter, coherent versions while retaining essential points and key information. This is particularly useful in reducing reading time, facilitating research, enhancing indexing, reducing bias, providing personalized information, and improving scalability in processing large volumes of text.

## 🔍 Why Automatic Text Summarization? 🔍
#### Reduces Reading Time: Provides quick insights into lengthy documents.
#### Facilitates Research: Helps in swiftly selecting relevant documents.
#### Enhances Indexing: Improves indexing systems' efficiency and accuracy.
#### Less Biased: Consistent and less biased than human summarization.
#### Personalized Information: Useful in personalized question-answering systems.
#### Scalability: Allows processing more documents efficiently for commercial abstract services.

## 📂 Dataset Description 📂
For this project, various datasets can be used, including:
#### News articles
#### Research papers
#### Wikipedia articles
#### Legal documents
#### Any large corpus of text documents
The chosen dataset should contain long-form texts suitable for summarization tasks. Each document in the dataset will be preprocessed and summarized using the steps outlined in the project.

## 🛠️ Project Design 🛠️
The project is designed to follow a series of steps to achieve effective text summarization:
#### Text Cleaning: Removal of unnecessary characters, symbols, and stop words.
#### Sentence Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual sentences.
#### Word Tokenization: Breaking sentences into individual words.
#### Word-Frequency Table: Creating a table to track the frequency of each word.
#### Summarization: Selecting sentences with the highest scores based on word frequency to form the summary.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies 🧰
#### Programming Language: Python
#### Libraries:
#### SpaCy: For NLP processing.
#### STOP_WORDS: From SpaCy for stop word removal.
#### string: For handling punctuation.
#### heapq: For selecting the top sentences based on scores.
#### SpaCy Language Model: 'en_core_web_sm' for English language processing.

## Implementation Procedure
#### 1.Install SpaCy and Download Language Model
#### 2.Import Necessary Libraries
#### 3.Load SpaCy Model
#### 4.Define the Text to Summarize
#### 5.Tokenize Text and Remove Stop Words and Punctuation
#### 6.Create Word-Frequency Table
#### 7.Normalize Frequencies
#### 8.Score Sentences
#### 9.Generate Summary

By following these steps, the project aims to create concise summaries of any lengthy text, thereby making text processing more efficient and effective. The implementation showcases the power of NLP in automating the summarization process and highlights its potential applications in various domains.
